        <p>Sneaker Store connects to young, fashion-conscious individuals through a premium brand experience featuring the best selection of authentic, sport-inspired sneakers. We define this premium experience through our products and the presentation of our brand.</p>
		<p>Buying from an online store has never been easier. Users are tired of the complex and unintuitive navigation systems in traditional online stores, so we provide a breath of fresh air with our sleek and dynamic experience. Our modern and clean design and smart filtering options are the major drivers of our success.</p>
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users don’t have the time or ability to visit physical stores and would rather buy their goods on the go or from home. Customers prefer convenient ways to perform various tasks that don’t take much of their time.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To solve this problem, I designed a native app to meet the needs of Sneaker Store’s customers. With so many online sneaker stores, it will be great to have an app that gives its users a customizable experience with their needs in mind.</p>

			  <h3>Usability Testings</h3>
			  <p>I recruited three users to perform the task of adding a Master Card as their preferred payment option. Overall I received positive feedback with only minimal pain points.</p>
			  <p><strong>Positive feedback:</strong>
			 <ul>
			  <li>The users felt the design was pretty straightforward.</li>
			  <li>The buttons were clearly recognizable.</li>
			  <li>The task of adding the credit card was clear.</li>
			  <li>Two users commented that having everything to fit on the screen was very helpful.</li>
			  <li>It was a nice touch of adding a product photo with payment confirmation.</li>
			  <li>All the users were excited to see what the final product will look like.</li>
			  <li>One tester liked the idea of having a store specific to only sneakers</li>
			  </ul></p>
			  <p><strong>Constructive feedback:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Adding a numb badge to indicate the number of items in the shopping bag.</li>
					<li>Adding an X (cancel) with secondary screens.</li>
					<li>When user testing, it would be a good idea to include bottom icons with the mid-fidelity design.</li>

			  <h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
			  <h3>Roadblocks</h3>
			  <p>Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project because it offered a lot of learning opportunities and a lot of room to be creative. The roadblock that I encountered was testing my mid fidelity wireframes. I noticed that users find it easier to perform tasks when a design is fully flushed out. Moving forward, I need to give more detail or communicate that the design is still at its rough stage. However, two of my users had no issues because they assisted with past user tests.</p> 
			  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
				<p>I learned that building a solid UI library will make the design process move quickly. I find that font weights and sizes don’t vary too much on mobile. Typestyles can easily translate to multiple projects. Finally, designing in black and white and not applying color until after user testing speeds up the design process.</p>
			<h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>
				<p>Even though it wasn’t required for this project, my design process should always include personas. This will give the design some personality, especially at checkout. To speed up this process, I can create a reusable persona template and modify based on the project specifications.</p>
